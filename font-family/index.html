        <font> ðŸ’” Love knocked, but never stayed too long, Each heartbeat hummed a <br> 
            lonesome song. Petals fell from roses red, While promises turned cold <br>
            instead. Shadows danced where dreams once tread, And silence screamed <br>
            what words had fled. Still, they hope where hearts have bled. </font>

        <font color="purple" size="10px" face="cursive"> Heartbreak isnâ€™t loudâ€”itâ€™s the silence after your name leaves their lips for the last time. <br> Itâ€™s waking up and instinctively reaching for someone whoâ€™s no longer there. Every song feels like a memory, and even the sky seems to echo your sorrow. <br> You replay moments not to remember, but to understand where it all slipped through your fingers. Love once felt infinite, but now you count the hours in sighs and empty glances. You smile to hide the tremble in your chest, pretending the world hasnâ€™t lost its color. The things they left behindâ€”words, places, scentsâ€”feel heavier than ever. Still, thereâ€™s grace in loving deeply, even when the ending wasnâ€™t yours to choose. The ache teaches you softness, patience, and strength in letting go. And someday, the heart that broke will quietly learn how to bloom again. </font>
