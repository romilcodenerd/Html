            <marquee direction="right"> A mother is the heart of a family, radiating love, warmth, and care.
            She nurtures her children with endless patience and unwavering support.
            From sleepless nights to joyful milestones, she is always by their side.
            Her sacrifices often go unnoticed, yet she never seeks recognition.
            A mother’s embrace can heal wounds that words cannot.
            She teaches values, instills confidence, and shapes character.
            Her strength lies in her gentleness and her courage in her compassion.
            Whether through a smile or a stern word, her love is always present.
            She is a guiding light in times of darkness and a cheerleader in times of triumph.
            Truly, a mother’s love is one of life’s most powerful and enduring gifts.
